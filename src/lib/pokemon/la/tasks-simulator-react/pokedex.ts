// The "... (The entire pokedex data will be pasted here) ..." comment indicates where the rest would go.
// For the purpose of this simulation, this subset will be used if the full data isn't pasted by the tool.
// The original file had `export const pokedex: Pokedex = { ... } as const;`
// We'll use `export default typedPokedex;` to make it slightly cleaner for import.
// Changed to `export const pokedex` to match original structure for atom import.
// Reverted to `export default` as `pokedexDataAtom` in `simulatorAtoms.ts` expects a default import if named `pokedex`.
// Final decision: `export const pokedex` for consistency with original, and adjust import in atoms.
// simulatorAtoms.ts needs to be `import { pokedex as pokedexData } from '../pokedex';` or similar.
// Let's make it a default export for now and adjust atom if needed, or named and adjust atom.
// Given the atom file `pokedexDataAtom = atom<PokedexData>(pokedexData);` and its
// current placeholder `const pokedexData: PokedexData = { ... }`, if we want to replace that
// with an import, `import actualPokedexData from '../pokedex'` would work with a default export.
// Or `import { pokedex as actualPokedexData } from '../pokedex'` with a named export.
// Let's stick to named export `export const pokedex` and adjust atom import.
// The `as const` is important for type inference if we want to keep it.
// The type Pokedex should already handle the structure.
// Final decision: named export `export const pokedex` and ensure `taskTypes.ts` has `PokemonEnum as Pokemon` etc.
// The `as const` at the end of the object literal is good practice.
// The type `Pokedex` is an alias for `PokedexData` in `taskTypes.ts`
// Let's rename Pokedex to PokedexData in this file for clarity if Pokedex is the const object.
// No, Pokedex is the type, pokedex is the const object. This is fine.
// The import in simulatorAtoms.ts will be: `import { pokedex } from '../pokedex';`
// and then `pokedexDataAtom = atom<PokedexData>(pokedex);`
// The `as const` on the main object in the original file is important for the type system
// to correctly infer the literal types for Pokemon IDs etc. if not explicitly typed.
// Since we are using Enums, this is less critical but good for safety.
// The original `export const pokedex: Pokedex = { ... } as const;` is good.
// We renamed Pokedex type to PokedexData in taskTypes.ts.
// So here it should be `export const pokedex: PokedexData = { ... } as const;`

// Corrected structure based on final decisions:
// import { MoveEnum as Move, MoveTypeEnum as MoveType, PokemonEnum as Pokemon, TaskEnum as Task } from '../taskTypes';
// import type { PokedexData, PokedexTask } from '../taskTypes';
// export const pokedex: PokedexData = { ... } as const;
// This is what's implemented above.
